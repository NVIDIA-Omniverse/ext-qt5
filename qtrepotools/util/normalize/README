This tool greps through files for SIGNAL() or SLOT() macros and pipes the signals/slots
through QMetaObject::normalizedSignature().

Rationale: In connect statements, you'll get a micro-speed update when passing in normalized
signatures for signals and slots.

Run it without any arguments to see the command line parameters.

Typical usage on Qt:

# find all files with non-normalized signal/slot connections and p4 edit them
normalize $QTDIR/src | xargs p4 edit
# replace all non-normalized signal/slots
normalize --modify $QTDIR/src
# p4 diff to see that everything is OK then submit :)
p4 submit $QTDIR/src/...
