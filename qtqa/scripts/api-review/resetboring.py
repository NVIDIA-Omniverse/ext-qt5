"""Script to exclude boring changes from the staging area for a commit

We start on a branch off an old release, with headers from a newer
branch checked out (and thus staged) in it; git diff should say
nothing, while git diff --cached describes how the headers have
changed.  We want to separate the boring changes (e.g. to copyright
headers) from the interesting ones (actual changes to the API).

The basic idea is to do an automated git reset -p that discards any
hunk entirely in the copyright header (recognized by its $-delimited
end marker) and, for any other hunks present, checks for certain
standard boring changes that we want to ignore.  If such changes are
present, the hunk is replaced by one that omits the given boring
changes; otherwise, the hunk is left alone.  Once we are done, git
diff --cached should contain nothing boring and git diff should be
entirely boring.  Only git's staging area is changed.

This script emits to stdout the names of files that should be restored
to their prior version (i.e. as in the old release; for files from the
newer branch, this should remove them); it is left to the script
driving this one (api-review-gen) to act on that.  Passing --disclaim
as a command-line option ensures all changed files with (known
variants on) the usual 'We mean it' disclaimer shall be named in this
output.

Errors and warnings are sent to stderr, not stdout.
Nothing is read from standard input.

    """Handles removing boring changes from one file.

    The aim is to remove noise from header diffs, so that reviewers
    can focus on the small amounts of meaningful change and not waste
    time making sense of boring changes - such as declaring a method
    nothrow or constexpr; or changes to copyright headers - just so as
    to be sure they can be ignored.  Here, we automate ignoring those
    changes, so that real changes don't get missed by a reviewer so
    busy skipping over boring changes as to not notice the other
    changes mixed in with them.

    The instance serves as carrier for data needed by all parts of the
    filtering process, which is driven by the .refine() method.  A
    .restore() method is also provided to support putting back a
    deleted file.

    In .refine(), each diff hunk is studied to see whether any of the
    new versions' lines contain fragments that, if missing from the
    corresponding prior line, would indicate a boring change.  The
    Censor tool-class provides the tools used to decide what changes
    are boring.  Its .minimize() represents a line by a token
    sequence, with various 'boring' changes undone, that can be used
    to match a new line with an old, from which it has been derived by
    boring changes (even if the old also contained boring fragments).
    Once an old and new line have been found, that this identifies as
    matching, the .harmonize() will undo, from the new line, only
    those boring changes that are absent from the old, so as to reduce
    the new line to a form matching the old as closely as possible.

    Potential matching old lines are sought anywhere in the same hunk
    of diff as the new line to be matched, to allow for small
    movements and for diff being confused, by distractions, into
    misreporting; however, a line moved so far that its new and old
    forms appear in separate hunks shall not be matched up.  The old
    shall be seen as removed and the new as added, without any tidying
    of the new.  (Note that matching happens within hunks of the gross
    diff, before boring bits are filtered out: it is possible that,
    after filtering out other boring changes, the revised diff you
    actually come to review might bring together in a single hunk the
    old and new lines of a boring change that weren't in the same
    chunk when .refine()ing the original diff.)
