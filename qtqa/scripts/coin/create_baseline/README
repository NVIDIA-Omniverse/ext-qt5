## Create Production Baseline ##

The script "create_baseline.sh" will merge origin/master to production
and the script "test_baseline.sh" will execute the integrations tests
on the Coin webserver.

Step summary:
 1. Create New Production Baseline
 2. Test New Production Baseline
 3. Update the baseline commit in Gerrit with test results
 4. Approve the commit in Gerrit
 5. Update Coin Production

# Create New Production Baseline

Option 1) Merge origin/master to production:
   ./create_baseline

Option 2) Merge {master-commit} to production:
   ./create_baseline {master-commit}

# Test New Production Baseline #

After the baseline has been created, you may continue with testing
   ./test_baseline

NOTE: If any test is skipped, failed or there is odd behavior, this
should be mentioned as a comment on the change.

# Update Coin Production (requirements)

The production merge commit is pushed automatically in the repository under
the author specified in git configuration. The commit needs to be approved
by review in Gerrit. After the commit is approved and merged in the production
branch, the Coin production can be updated with 'git pull --rebase'.

## TODO ##
- Make baseline scripts non-interactive
- Auto schedule (nightly)
- Add usage help for arguments
