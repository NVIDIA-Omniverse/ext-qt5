    \brief An API to navigate and query documents using their meta-data.

    The Qt DocGallery provides APIs to navigate and query documents using their
    meta-data.

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Overview

    The Qt DocGallery provides an API for navigating and querying documents
    using their meta-data. The common use case would be populating the media
    selection views of a music player, or image viewer. It also provides APIs
    for querying and editing the meta-data of individual documents.

    Typically all files in user directories should be available in the
    document gallery. The principal types are Audio, Video, Image, and
    Document, but files can also be categorized as a File, Folder, Text,
    or Playlist. There are also some meta-types composed from the meta-data
    of files, these are Artist, Album, AudioGenre, and PhotoAlbum.

    The document gallery API is composed of a set of asynchronous request
    (\l QGalleryAbstractRequest) classes which talk to the system file indexing
    service, this would be e.g. Tracker on certain Linux distributions, and
    potentially Windows Search, or Spotlight on macs.
    There are three requests; \l QGalleryQueryRequest takes a type, a parent
    item, and some filtering criteria (\l QGalleryFilter) and returns
    meta-data for all matching items.
    \l QGalleryItemRequest takes an item ID and returns meta-data for just that
    item.  And \l QGalleryTypeRequest takes an item type and returns meta-data
    describing that type.

    The requests operate on implementations of the \l QAbstractGallery.
    The default implementation is \l QDocumentGallery, but it's possible to
    create alternative implementations which talk to a media server or web
    services.

    The primary interface to the results of a request is the
    \l QGalleryResultSet class which provides accessors for reading and writing
    the meta-data of a set of items.

    A \l QGalleryResultSet cannot be created directly and may not need to be
    accessed directly, instead an instance must be requested from a gallery
    using one of the gallery request classes which typically also provide
    convenience functions for accessing the items in a result set.


    \section2 Requests

    The gallery request classes inherit from \l QGalleryAbstractRequest and
    are used to fetch items from a gallery, or to initiate service provided
    by a gallery.

    \section2 Filters

    The filter classes provide a way to describe meta-data criteria items must
    satisfy to be included in the results of some requests.

    \section2 Galleries

    The gallery classes provide instances of different gallery types.  Currently
    the only gallery type is the Document Gallery.

    \section2 QGalleryQueryModel

    The \l QGalleryQueryModel class implements a QAbstractItemModel using
    QGalleryQueryRequest.  This is a convenience class which simplifies the
    process of presenting gallery items in a list view.


    \section2 \l QML Elements

    QML elements providing access to the document gallery are implemented in
    the \l {Gallery QML Plugin}.
