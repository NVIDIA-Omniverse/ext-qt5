    \title Qt Versit
    \brief Qt Versit enables clients to import and export contact and calendar
    information in vCard and iCalendar formats.

    Most of the time your contacts do not remain in isolation in a single
    device, but coexist on various mobile phones, computers, and servers. A
    standard way to exchange the contacts is through the Versit \reg documents.

    The Qt Versit API enables you to import calendar or contact information in
    VCard and iCalendar format to the Qt Organizer and Qt Contact API, and to
    store the information on the current platform. Alternatively, you can
    export organizer and contact information to VCal or iCalendar files which
    you can then import into other calendars and contact storages, or easily
    share through Bluetooth or email, for example.

    The \l{Qt Organizer} module has information about supported
    \l{Supported iCalendar Features}{iCalendar features}.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following
    directives. The generic Qt Versit is used in the contacts use case, and it
    is extended with Qt Organizer:
